/**
 * 
 * A Structured table. This is used internally by {@link TableBuilder#getTable()}. Essentially it allows to represent
 * a piece of the final resulting table as a list of nested columns (similarly to what it is done in {@link TabValueGroup})
 * This way it's easy to build the final table by progressively merging the nodes that are found in the set of paths that 
 * {@link MinFlowCalculator#getMinPathCover()} obtains from the initial input. 
 * A structured table is composed of an header, an array of values for that header (ie, the column) and optionally 
 * a tail, which represent linked headers and their values. The header columns and the tail columns need to be kept 
 * together when new header/values are merged into an existing structured table. A structured table is built by 
 * merging multiple {@link TabValueGroup}.
