<h1>The graph-to-spreadsheet conversion algorithm</h1>

<p>This library is a generic implementation of methods that allow one to convert the graph of an experiment work flow 
(e.g., MAGE, MAGETAB, BII) into a tabular format (eg, MAGETAB, ISATAB). It is mainly based on the idea of finding a minimum 
set of paths that cover all the graph nodes and edges. This, in turn, is computed by computing a particular minimum flow 
on the graph from the source nodes (e.g., bio-sources or samples) to the sinks (e.g., data, derived data nodes).</p>

<p>The package is designed in a way that allows to adapt a particular object model (e.g., MAGE-OM or AE2) and to
    reuse classes like {@link TableBuilder} to produce spreadsheets describing a particular experimental pipeline (i.e.,
    CSV/TSV files) in a particular format (e.g., MAGETAB or ISATAB). See graph2tab_intro.pdf for details.</p>
