<h1>The graph-to-spreadsheet conversion algorithm</h1>

<p>This package is a generic implementation of a method for producing spreadsheets out of pipeline graph.
    It is based on the node splitting approach: all the nodes in the input pipeline are reduced to "chain nodes", i.e.:
    nodes that have at most one input and at most one output. This is done by taking those nodes having splittings
    or pooling, creating copies of them and distributing the excessive inputs or outputs over the copies.
    See the class {@link ChainsBuilder} for details about such procedure.</p>

<p>The package is designed in a way that allows to adapt a particular object model (eg.: ISATAB or MAGETAB) and to
    reuse classes like {@link TableBuilder} to produce spreadsheets describing a particular experimental pipeline (ie.:
    CSV/TSV files). This is done by means of the {@link Node} interface.</p>
