/**
 * <p>
 * The graph-to-table conversion algorithm.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * This applies the method of node splitting: when an experimental graph node is not normalized, ie: has not at most one
 * input and at most one output, it is duplicated into multiple nodes, so that it is possible to redistribute the excess
 * of nodes. The final result is that the initial graph to be converted is transformed into a set of chains, each
 * corresponding to one row of the exported spreadsheet.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * <b>PLEASE NOTE</b>: we assume that the graph is already layered, ie: every path from a source (a node without inputs)
 * to a destination (a node without outputs) has the same number of nodes of the others and has the same type of nodes
 * at any given layer. The latter means eg.: that the sources are all biosources and at distance 1 from them there are
 * always bio-samples. All the nodes involved must be reachable from the parameter passed to the constructor.
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * <b>DEBUGGING NOTE</b>: you can see how the initial graph is transformed by setting the system property
 * graph2tab.debug_mode=true. This can be done this way in maven:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   mvn -DargLine='-Dgraph2tab.debug_mode=true' -Dtest=[YourTest] test
 * </pre
 *
