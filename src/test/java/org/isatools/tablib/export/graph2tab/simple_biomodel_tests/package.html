<h1>The Simple Biomodel Example</h1>

<p>Here we use a simple, but realistic, model of an experimental graph. The model is similar to what is found
    in the formats MAGETAB or ISATAB. We show how a model like that can be adapted to the Node interface, required
    by the library and, from that, how to generate the table representing the graph.</p>

<p>
    As you'll see in the code, this is the typical approach to adapt your model:
<ol>
    <li>Define node wrappers for your object model (see node_wrappers package). Leave getInputs()/getOutputs()
        temporarily
        unimplemented.
    </li>
    <li>Define a Node Wrapper Factory (see node_wrappers/NodeFactory). Complete getInputs()/getOutputs() by using your
        factory
    </li>
    <li>Define a custom implementation of TableBuilder, so that you can instantiate it with the initial nodes that allow
        to
        reach of your experimental graph (See SimpleModelTableBuilder).
    </li>
    <li>Use the table builder and get the result from getTable() (See SimpleBioModelTest).</li>
</ol>
