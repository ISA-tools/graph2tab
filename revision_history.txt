REVISION HISTORY

- 2.0 
	Moved out of the ISA project and made an independent pacakge. Layering added to the 1.0 version, some bug fixes

- 2.0.1
	exportTSV() methods added to TableBuilder, which exports the table into table-delimited format.

- 2.0.2
	Temporary patch to allow the insertion of Unit[Type](Qualifier). The way header groups are represented will be channged
	and made simpler.

- 3.0
	New approach for Node.tabValues, now TabValueGroup(s) can be nested and groups of headers that go together can be taken
	into account (eg, Characteristics, Term Source REF, Term Accession Number).
	
- 4.0
	New algorithm for computing the minimum path set that covers all the graph, now based on the computation of the
	minimum flow from the sources to the sinks.

- 4.1 
  A bug about isolated nodes was fixed. Nodes without any input and any output used to cause an infinite loop in 
  MinFlowCalculator.getMinPathCover(). Now a proper check is added to avoid such a situation.
