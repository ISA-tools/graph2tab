REVISION HISTORY

4.4.1-SNAPSHOT
  - Escape character '\' added to reportTSV()
  - Experimental migration to EBI/Nexus Maven repository
  

4.4
  - Migrated to JRE/JDK 1.7
	- Minor changes on toString() methods and alike.

4.3.1
	- DefaultAbstractNode.id is now based on UUID, since the approach based on static integer might not work with applications
	(e.g., servers) that load the class once and never reloads it (i.e., we might overflow the max long limit).
	
4.3
	- Some features added to ease table post-processing
	- Bugfix in TableBuilder and LayersBuilder.toString(), getLayers(), which didn't return layers in layer order, is 
	replaced with a loop over all the layers.	

4.2.2
	- jutils dependency upgraded to 1.4. Change to FlowInitialiser.getStartNodes() to improve its speed 
	(many thanks to Adam Faulconbridge for the suggestion).
	
4.2
	- Improvement of LayersBuilder.computeTypedLayers(), now it is O(n), instead of O(n^2).
	- A potential bug in LayersBuilder.setLayer(Node, int) fixed (conditions for updating maxLayer).

4.1 
	- A bug about isolated nodes was fixed. Nodes without any input and any output used to cause an infinite loop in 
	MinFlowCalculator.getMinPathCover(). Now a proper check is added to avoid such a situation.
	- A potential bug in LayersBuilder.computeTypedLayers() fixed (a sequence of if, instead of if/elseif).

4.0
	- New algorithm for computing the minimum path set that covers all the graph, now based on the computation of the
	minimum flow from the sources to the sinks.

3.0
	- New approach for Node.tabValues, now TabValueGroup(s) can be nested and groups of headers that go together can be taken
	into account (e.g., Characteristics, Term Source REF, Term Accession Number).

2.0.2
	- Temporary patch to allow the insertion of Unit[Type](Qualifier). The way header groups are represented will be changed
	and made simpler.

2.0.1
	- exportTSV() methods added to TableBuilder, which exports the table into table-delimited format.

2.0 
	- Moved out of the ISA project and made an independent package. Layering added to the 1.0 version, some bug fixes.
