REVISION HISTORY

- 2.0 
	Moved out of the ISA project and made an independent package. Layering added to the 1.0 version, some bug fixes.

- 2.0.1
	exportTSV() methods added to TableBuilder, which exports the table into table-delimited format.

- 2.0.2
	Temporary patch to allow the insertion of Unit[Type](Qualifier). The way header groups are represented will be changed
	and made simpler.

- 3.0
	New approach for Node.tabValues, now TabValueGroup(s) can be nested and groups of headers that go together can be taken
	into account (e.g., Characteristics, Term Source REF, Term Accession Number).
	
- 4.0
	New algorithm for computing the minimum path set that covers all the graph, now based on the computation of the
	minimum flow from the sources to the sinks.

- 4.1 
  A bug about isolated nodes was fixed. Nodes without any input and any output used to cause an infinite loop in 
  MinFlowCalculator.getMinPathCover(). Now a proper check is added to avoid such a situation.
  
  A potential bug in LayersBuilder.computeTypedLayers() fixed (a sequence of if, instead of if/elseif).

- 4.2
  Improvement of LayersBuilder.computeTypedLayers(), now it is O(n), instead of O(n^2).  
  A potential bug in LayersBuilder.setLayer(Node, int) fixed (conditions for updated of maxLayer).
  
- 4.2.2
  jutils dependency upgraded to 1.4. Change to FlowInitialiser.getStartNodes() to improve its speed (suggested by
  Adam Faulconbridge.
